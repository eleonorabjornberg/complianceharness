"""Synthetic subjects.

Collectors are tested against repositories built here, never against
this repository or the developer's own machine. A test that reads the
real filesystem passes or fails for reasons that have nothing to do with
the code, and under autonomous delivery that is how a suite quietly
stops meaning anything.
